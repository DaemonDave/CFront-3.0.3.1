Release E

    Release E was the February 1985 "educational" release of Cfront. With
    the exception of parts of the makefile, Stroustrup believes that
    every word and every line of code of Release E was written by him.
    The first page of the source code has a handwritten diagram of the
    directory structure and a message to Stroustrup signed "SCD" (Steve
    Dewhurst).
