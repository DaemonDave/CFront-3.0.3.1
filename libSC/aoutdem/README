Hi!

This is the AT&T C++ a.out demangler.   Run it on an a.out file generated
by AT&T C++, and it will clean up the mangled names for you.  Use the -d option
to clean up your a.out prior to debugging.

Notice that the a.out demangler is not the same as the demangler library that 
comes with AT&T C++.  The a.out demangler uses the demangler library.

---------------------
NEW FOR THIS RELEASE:
	. Handles nested classes, types, etc. correctly.
	. libmangle.a uncoupled from this tool.  The build process
	  for this tool assumes you have the latest version of
	  libmangle.a somewhere on your library search path.
	. dem, c++filt, and errfilt no longer shipped with this tool.
	. BSD memory bug probably eliminated by my fix to libmangle.a.

NEW FOR THIS RELEASE:
	. Added -T switch.
	. Changed meaning of -d to be -T -q__ instead of -t -q__.

NEW FOR THIS RELEASE:
	. The shipment now contains all three tools of the above
	  tools, not just the a.out demangler.
	. libmangle.a is automatically built as part of the shipment.

NEW FOR THIS RELEASE:
	. More makefile options for yet more perverted machines.

NEW FOR THIS RELEASE:
	. It's much faster.
	. Bug fix - some class members weren't getting demangled.
	. Bug fix - on System V, some auxiliary entries were getting corrupted.
	. New switches; see the manpage.
	. Name of -dbx switch changed to -d, since it's used with sdb too.

NEW FOR THIS RELEASE:
	. Now works on HP-UX.

NEW FOR THIS RELEASE:
	. It's faster.
